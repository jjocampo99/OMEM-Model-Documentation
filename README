What is the purpose of the study?:

Model the concept of bonding curves for CIC, and different modes of exchange. Simulate possible scenarios as an input for the development of governance rules.

For whom is the model designed?:

The model is designed for Grassroot Economics (platform designers). 
Potentially, this model could be of educational interest for stakeholders 
(i.e. Communities, potential funders of CIC, and scholars) that are not involved in the technicalities of the platform and would like to learn how it works in a low risk environment.


What is the model doing?:

•	Simulate different actors that are present in these type of currencies (modes of exchange)
•	Analyse the economic efficiency of the CIC, by comparing different actors
•	Explore the concepts of CIC and Bounding Curves

•	Use the concept of Bounding Curves in the development of a CIC
•	Develop a model that helps in explaining the concept of BC to relevant stakeholders
•	Simulate different scenarios that could inspire different practical decision-making for the monetary designers (i.e. Grassroot Economics)
•	Reflect on the benefits and challenges of using a BC approach in communities with different modes of exchange (in terms of monetary model)


To run this model you need NETLOGO version6.1
